  <h1>Tech Milestones</h1>
  <h2>1946 - ENIAC</h2>
  <p id="para1">In the 40s development of computers was in its infancy, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was made by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly. Built in 1946 at the University of Pennsylvania, it’s described as the “first general-purpose electronic computer,” ENIAC was able to compute mathematical equations and had a great memory.</p>
  <h2>1972 - Magnavox Odyssey</h2>
  <p id="para2">Back in the 70’s, before the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and PS5, gaming wasn’t really a thing. However, in September 1972, the company Magnavox created the Magnavox Odyssey, the world’s first gaming console. Although the games were simple, such as the headliner of Table Tennis (Pong). This led to the creation of some of the best consoles and games we’ve seen! (Even if Atari saturated the market.)

  <h2>1981 - IBM’s Personal Computer</h2>
  <p id="para3">In August 1981, IBM launched its Personal Computer (PC for short). While PCs have been available since the 1970’s, IBM’s PC set the standard for what it meant to be an at home, personal computer. The IBM 5150 had 16KB of user memory and 40KB of read-only memory, which is memory read at high speeds but isn’t able to change. The computer has a built-in speaker, the ability to run self diagnostic checks, as well as the capability to use Microsoft’s MS-DOS operating system.

  <h2>1989 - The World Wide Web</h2>
  <p id="para4">In 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for an information system at CERN. Around a year later, the first website and server went live at CERN. From there the Web has evolved from a simple website, to hundreds of pages, chatrooms, and media. Websites started from everyday people, some good, bad, and some like goatse. Which for school appropriate language, I won’t delve into.</p>
  <h2>2000 - Broadband Internet</h2>
  <p id="para5">While websites are great, it’s hard to access them without floppy discs, thus the age of the internet started. With the rise of broadband internet, online sites are now accessible by the general public. Of course that's all well in good, however with every good there is a bad.</p>
